# Session: Improve Frontend Test Coverage

**Date**: 2025-10-15 15:20
**Status**: In Progress

## Session Overview

**Start Time**: 15:20
**Current Coverage**: 14.18% overall
**Component Coverage**: 68.77%
**Utils Coverage**: 0%

## Goals

**Primary Goal**: Improve frontend test coverage from 14.18% to a more reasonable level

### Current State Analysis
- ‚úÖ Well-tested components: Input (100%), Card (100%), Button (100%), ProtocolSelector (95.34%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially tested: ProtocolUpload (58%)
- ‚ùå Untested components: ICFGenerationDashboard (0%), ICFSection (0%), Textarea (0%)
- ‚ùå Untested utilities: api.ts (0%), docxGenerator.ts (0%), markdownGenerator.ts (0%), pdfExtractor.ts (0%), pdfGenerator.ts (0%)

### Target Areas (To Be Confirmed with User)
1. **Quick wins**: Textarea component (simple component)
2. **API utilities**: api.ts (critical for backend communication)
3. **ICF components**: ICFGenerationDashboard and ICFSection (core features)
4. **Document generators**: PDF/DOCX/Markdown generators (complex, may need integration tests)

### Questions for User
- What coverage target should we aim for? (30%? 50%? Focus on specific areas?)
- Which components/utilities are highest priority?
- Should we focus on unit tests or also consider integration/E2E tests?

## Testing Strategy

**User Goal**: 80% coverage across all areas

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Target: +20% coverage)
1. **Textarea component** (21 lines) - Simple component, similar to Input
2. **Complete ProtocolUpload** (564 lines, currently 58%) - Fill in missing paths

### Phase 2: Critical Utilities (Target: +30% coverage)
3. **api.ts** (268 lines) - Core API client with streaming generators

###Phase 3: ICF Components (Target: +20% coverage)
4. **ICFSection** (365 lines) - Individual section component
5. **ICFGenerationDashboard** (828 lines) - Main dashboard component

### Phase 4: Document Utilities (Target: +10% coverage)
6. **pdfExtractor.ts** (121 lines) - PDF text extraction
7. Evaluate generators (docx, markdown, pdf) - May need integration tests

## Progress

### Phase 1: Quick Wins
- ‚úÖ Created feature branch: `feature/improve-frontend-test-coverage`
- ‚úÖ Analyzed codebase (15 source files, 4,345 total lines)
- üîÑ Creating tests for Textarea component

## Branch

**Branch**: `feature/improve-frontend-test-coverage` (created from main)
