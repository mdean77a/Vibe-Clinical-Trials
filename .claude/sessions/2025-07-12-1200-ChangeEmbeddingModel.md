# ChangeEmbeddingModel Session
**Started:** July 12, 2025 at 12:00 PM

## Session Overview
This session focuses on changing the embedding model used in the Clinical Trial Accelerator application. Currently using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, we'll evaluate and potentially migrate to a different embedding model for improved performance, cost optimization, or other requirements.

## Goals
- [ ] Evaluate current embedding model usage and performance
- [ ] Research alternative embedding models (e.g., newer OpenAI models, open-source alternatives)
- [ ] Implement embedding model change with minimal disruption
- [ ] Update configuration and environment variables
- [ ] Test compatibility with existing Qdrant vector database
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass after model change
- [ ] Document the change and any performance impacts

## Progress
