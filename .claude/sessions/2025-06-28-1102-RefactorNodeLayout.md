# RefactorNodeLayout Session - 2025-06-28 11:02

## Session Overview
**Start Time:** 2025-06-28 11:02 AM

## Goals
Remove mock/local data support and show error message when API is not running

## Progress

### Update - 2025-06-28 11:26 AM

**Summary**: Removed local data fallback and implemented API-only mode with CORS proxy

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: frontend/app/page.tsx, frontend/app/document-selection/page.tsx, frontend/app/informed-consent/page.tsx, frontend/app/site-checklist/page.tsx
- Modified: frontend/src/components/ProtocolSelector.tsx, frontend/src/components/icf/ICFGenerationDashboard.tsx
- Modified: frontend/src/utils/api.ts, frontend/next.config.js
- Deleted: frontend/src/utils/mockData.ts
- Added: frontend/src/types/protocol.ts, frontend/app/api/[...path]/route.ts
- Current branch: eliminateLocalDataMock (commit: 9b6f2f9)

**Todo Progress**: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Create Next.js API route proxy to handle CORS

**Details**: 
- Refactored app to remove all mock data support
- Now displays error message "Backend API is not running. Please start the backend server to use this application." when API is unavailable
- Moved Protocol type definition from mockData.ts to new types/protocol.ts file
- Created Next.js API route proxy to handle CORS issues when frontend and backend run on different hosts
- Removed conflicting rewrite rule from next.config.js that was causing CORS errors
- All components now require backend API to be running - no local data fallback

### Update - 2025-06-28 11:51 AM

**Summary**: Fixed ICF generation issues by reverting proxy approach and cleaning up configuration

**Git Changes**:
- Deleted: frontend/.env.local
- Modified: frontend/src/utils/api.ts
- Current branch: eliminateLocalDataMock (commit: 9b6f2f9)

**Todo Progress**: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Fix CORS issue with proper frontend URL configuration

**Issues Encountered**:
- ICF generation streaming worked but had no successful context retrieval
- Proxy approach was interfering with backend request processing
- Unnecessary .env.local file was overriding default API configuration

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Reverted from proxy approach back to direct API calls
- Removed API proxy route (/app/api/[...path]/route.ts)
- Deleted unnecessary .env.local file - code already has proper fallback to http://localhost:8000/api
- Restored direct backend communication for proper context retrieval during ICF generation

### Todo Summary
**Tasks Completed**: 6/6 (100%)
- ✓ Find where the app detects API connection status
- ✓ Locate mock/local data implementation
- ✓ Replace local data logic with API connection error message
- ✓ Remove unnecessary mock data files and code
- ✓ Create Next.js API route proxy to handle CORS (later reverted)
- ✓ Fix CORS issue with proper frontend URL configuration

**Tasks Remaining**: 0

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Eliminated Local Data Fallback**: Completely removed mock data support from the application
2. **Improved Error Handling**: App now shows clear error message when backend API is unavailable
3. **Code Reorganization**: Moved Protocol type to dedicated types directory
4. **Fixed ICF Generation**: Resolved context retrieval issues by reverting from proxy to direct API calls
5. **Simplified Configuration**: Removed unnecessary environment files

### Features Implemented
- **API-Only Mode**: Application requires backend to be running, no local fallback
- **Clear Error Messaging**: User-friendly error when API is unavailable
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types for Protocol interface
- **Direct API Communication**: Restored for optimal ICF generation with context retrieval

### Problems Encountered and Solutions
1. **CORS Issues**: Initial problem with different origins (169.254.196.125:3000 vs localhost:8000)
   - **Solution**: Tried proxy approach first, then reverted to direct calls with localhost usage
2. **ICF Generation Context Loss**: Proxy was interfering with backend request processing
   - **Solution**: Reverted to direct API calls to preserve request context
3. **Configuration Complexity**: Unnecessary .env.local file was overriding defaults
   - **Solution**: Removed file, relied on code fallbacks

### Breaking Changes
- **Mock Data Removal**: Applications no longer work offline or without backend
- **localStorage Protocols**: No longer populated with mock data for fallback
- **Upload Behavior**: Protocol uploads now fail immediately if API unavailable

### Important Findings
- **Proxy Interference**: Next.js API routes can interfere with complex backend operations like streaming
- **Environment Variables**: Default fallbacks in code are often sufficient for simple configurations
- **CORS Best Practice**: Using localhost for both frontend and backend avoids CORS issues entirely

### Configuration Changes
- **next.config.js**: Removed conflicting rewrite rule for `/api/:path*`
- **API Configuration**: Restored direct backend calls to `http://localhost:8000/api`
- **Import Structure**: Updated all components to import from `@/types/protocol`

### Dependencies
- **No Changes**: No package.json dependencies added or removed
- **Type Structure**: Created new types directory for better organization

### What Wasn't Completed
- **Git Commit**: Changes remain uncommitted on `eliminateLocalDataMock` branch
- **Testing**: No tests updated to reflect mock data removal
- **Documentation**: README or other docs not updated for new API-only requirement

### Tips for Future Developers
1. **CORS Resolution**: Use localhost for both frontend (http://localhost:3000) and backend (http://localhost:8000) to avoid CORS
2. **API Dependency**: Ensure backend is running before testing frontend functionality
3. **Error States**: App gracefully handles API unavailability with clear user messaging
4. **Streaming Endpoints**: Direct API calls work better than proxies for complex operations like ICF generation
5. **Environment Setup**: No environment files needed - code has sensible defaults
6. **Type Safety**: All Protocol-related types are now in `/src/types/protocol.ts`

### Lessons Learned
- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Direct API calls often work better than elaborate proxy solutions
- **Environment Configuration**: Don't over-engineer configuration when simple defaults suffice
- **Context Preservation**: Some backend operations require direct client communication to maintain state
- **User Experience**: Clear error messaging is crucial when removing fallback functionality
