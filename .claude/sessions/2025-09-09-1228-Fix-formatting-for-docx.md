**Started:** 2025-09-09 12:28 PM

## Session Overview
Starting a new session to fix DOCX generation markdown formatting issues, similar to the fixes that were previously applied to PDF generation.

## Goals
- [x] Implement proper markdown parsing for DOCX generation (inline formatting: bold, italic, code)
- [x] Add support for nested lists with proper indentation levels
- [x] Add support for tables in DOCX format
- [x] Add support for horizontal rules
- [x] Ensure feature parity with PDF generation formatting capabilities
- [x] Test with complex markdown content
- [x] Fix line spacing inconsistencies
- [x] Fix streaming completion detection for stuck sections

## Progress

### Initial Analysis
- Reviewed current DOCX generation implementation in `frontend/src/utils/docxGenerator.ts`
- Identified that the current implementation has basic markdown parsing but lacks:
  - Inline formatting (bold, italic, code)
  - Nested list support with proper indentation
  - Table support
  - Horizontal rule support
- Reviewed recent PDF generation fixes that successfully implemented these features

### DOCX Markdown Implementation (Completed)
- Ported enhanced markdown parsing from PDF generator to DOCX generator
- Added inline formatting support (bold, italic, code)
- Implemented nested list support with proper indentation levels
- Added table rendering with header row styling
- Added horizontal rule support using paragraph borders
- Created TextSegment interface for formatted text parts
- Enhanced parseMarkdownToElements with full markdown support
- Updated convertElementsToDocx to handle all markdown elements

### Line Spacing Fix (Completed)
- Fixed inconsistent line spacing throughout document
- Set uniform single line spacing (240 twips)
- Adjusted paragraph spacing for better consistency
- Removed 1.5x line spacing that was causing double-spacing

### Streaming Completion Detection Fix (Completed)
- Identified issue where sections get stuck in "generating" state
- Added finally blocks to ensure cleanup when stream ends
- Auto-finalize sections with content when stream completes
- Ensures isGenerating flag is always cleared
- Added logging to track auto-finalized sections
