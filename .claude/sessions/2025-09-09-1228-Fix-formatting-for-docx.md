**Started:** 2025-09-09 12:28 PM

## Session Overview
Starting a new session to fix DOCX generation markdown formatting issues, similar to the fixes that were previously applied to PDF generation.

## Goals
- [ ] Implement proper markdown parsing for DOCX generation (inline formatting: bold, italic, code)
- [ ] Add support for nested lists with proper indentation levels
- [ ] Add support for tables in DOCX format
- [ ] Add support for horizontal rules
- [ ] Ensure feature parity with PDF generation formatting capabilities
- [ ] Test with complex markdown content

## Progress

### Initial Analysis
- Reviewed current DOCX generation implementation in `frontend/src/utils/docxGenerator.ts`
- Identified that the current implementation has basic markdown parsing but lacks:
  - Inline formatting (bold, italic, code)
  - Nested list support with proper indentation
  - Table support
  - Horizontal rule support
- Reviewed recent PDF generation fixes that successfully implemented these features

### Next Steps
- Port the enhanced markdown parsing from PDF generator to DOCX generator
- Adapt the rendering logic to use docx.js formatting capabilities
