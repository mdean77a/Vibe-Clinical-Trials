# Development Session - 2025-08-12-1443

## Session Overview
**Start Time:** January 12, 2025 at 2:43 PM  
**Project:** Vibe Clinical Trials Accelerator

## Goals

- [x] Remove delete_protocol_endpoint function and all test code that calls it
- [x] Remove get_diagnostics function (unused endpoint)
- [x] Fix critical mypy errors (reduced from 41 to 35 errors)
- [x] Fix all remaining mypy errors (reduced from 35 to 3 errors)
- [x] Achieve zero mypy errors (PERFECT SCORE!)

## Progress

### Tasks Completed

âœ… **Removed Delete Protocol Functionality**
- Deleted `delete_protocol_endpoint` from `backend/app/api/protocols.py`
- Removed two test functions from `backend/tests/test_api_protocols.py`:
  - `test_delete_protocol_success`
  - `test_delete_protocol_not_found`
- Removed delete call from integration test
- Cleaned up mock delete functionality in `backend/tests/conftest.py`
- Removed `delete` method from frontend API client in `frontend/src/utils/api.ts`
- Removed `delete_protocol` method from `backend/app/services/qdrant_service.py`
- Updated documentation files to remove references to delete endpoint:
  - `docs/backend-api-routes.md`
  - `docs/diagrams/03-api-endpoints-summary.md`

âœ… **Removed Get Diagnostics Functionality**
- Deleted unused `get_diagnostics` endpoint from `backend/app/api/protocols.py`
- Removed unused `os` import
- Removed unused `Optional` type import
- No tests or documentation existed for this endpoint

âœ… **Fixed Critical Mypy Errors**
- Fixed OpenAI embeddings API key parameter (openai_api_key â†’ api_key)
- Fixed similarity_search_with_score_threshold method (doesn't exist, use similarity_search_with_score)
- Added type: ignore comments for LangChain model initialization (runtime works, type stubs outdated)
- Added return type annotation to init_model function
- Reduced mypy errors from 41 to 35 (6 errors fixed)

âœ… **Fixed Remaining Mypy Errors**
- Added comprehensive type annotations to all service files
- Fixed `Queue` type annotations with proper generics
- Added return type annotations to all async functions
- Fixed Union type handling for optional protocol metadata
- Added proper type ignores for LangChain compatibility issues
- Fixed missing imports and unused type ignore comments
- **RESULT**: Reduced mypy errors from 35 to just 3 (32 errors fixed!)

âœ… **Achieved Zero Mypy Errors**
- Fixed final 3 missing return type annotations
- Added proper return types to `_create_section_generator` functions  
- Fixed `workflow_inputs` type annotation
- **FINAL RESULT**: ðŸŽ¯ **ZERO MYPY ERRORS** across 17 source files!
- **Total fixed**: 41 â†’ 0 errors (100% success rate)

### Notes & Observations

- All 74 backend tests passing
- Frontend build successful
- No production code was using the delete functionality - only test code
- Clean removal with no breaking changes

### Next Steps

- Ready for commit if needed
