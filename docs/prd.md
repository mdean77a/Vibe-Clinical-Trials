# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Clinical Trial Accelerator - Enhanced Specification v2.0

---

## Executive Summary

### **Project Vision**
The Clinical Trial Accelerator is an AI-powered internal web application designed to revolutionize clinical trial document preparation by automatically generating regulatory-compliant trial documents from protocol PDFs using advanced AI workflows.

### **Business Problem**
Clinical trial sites currently spend 2-4 weeks manually creating essential trial documents (Informed Consent Forms, Site Initiation Checklists) from complex protocol PDFs. This manual process is:
- **Time-intensive**: 40-80 hours per protocol
- **Error-prone**: Manual transcription introduces compliance risks
- **Resource-heavy**: Requires specialized clinical research expertise
- **Bottleneck**: Delays trial startup and patient enrollment

### **Solution Overview**
An intelligent document generation system that:
- Ingests clinical trial protocol PDFs
- Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to understand protocol context
- Generates section-based regulatory documents via LangGraph workflows
- Provides human-in-the-loop editing and approval interface
- Exports publication-ready documents

### **Success Metrics**
- **Primary**: Reduce document preparation time from 2-4 weeks to 2-4 days (85% reduction)

**STATUS: READY FOR STORY GENERATION** ✅

This Enhanced PRD provides the comprehensive foundation needed for the Scrum Master to generate high-quality, implementable user stories with clear acceptance criteria and business context.

### **MVP Story Generation Priority**
For immediate development, the Scrum Master should focus on **MVP-specific stories** first:
1. **Epic 1.1-1.3**: Protocol management (Qdrant) and upload/processing stories
2. **Epic 2.1-2.2**: Basic RAG pipeline and dual document generation stories (ICF + Site Initiation Checklist)
3. **Epic 4.1**: Basic review interface stories (both document types with navigation)

**Key MVP Stories to Include**:
- **Protocol Management**:
  - Protocol selection landing page (display processed protocols)
  - Protocol selection workflow (choose existing protocol)
  - New protocol upload interface
  - Automatic metadata extraction (study acronym, protocol title)
  - Qdrant metadata operations (create, read, update)
  - Qdrant collection creation and management
- **Document Generation**:
  - Document type selection interface
  - ICF-specific generation workflow
  - Site Initiation Checklist-specific generation workflow  
  - Document type-specific review and editing interfaces
- **Session Management**:
  - Active protocol context management
  - Protocol-specific document naming and export

**Post-MVP stories** (DCC document types, advanced features, multi-user workflows) should be generated after MVP completion to avoid scope creep.
